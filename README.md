Alpha Stage allows developers to get feedback from all of their players! It comes with built in analytics and also records the user's gameplay so developers can see what their users are doing and what they can do to improve their games. We are currently working on a Unity Plugin to power up our analytics.

Alpha Stage is built on top of [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate) make sure to check them out!
